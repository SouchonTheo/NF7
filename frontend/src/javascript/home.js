                We - Basile Gros, Th√©o Souchon, Diego Rogard and Pablo Neyens - are N7 students. <br/>
                Our interest in NFT led us to create a website related to this topic. For us, this was the opportunity to dig deeper in this subject while learning the basics of web programming.
                We had the occasion to discover new technologies that will surely be very useful in our futur professional life, such as React or NodeJS.
